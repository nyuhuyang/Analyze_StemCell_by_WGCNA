# We compare sets of transcriptional profiles in several ways:
###    - by overall similarity eg using Spearman correlation
###    - by similarity of signatures - usually done using GSEA (my preferred approach)
###    - by first computing modules (using WCGNA) in each dataset,
###        then comparing overlap of modules using hypergeometric test
